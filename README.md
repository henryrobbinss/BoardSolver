# BoardSolver
Open Source picture/video based board game move solver

# Description

The goal of the board solver project is to create an open source project to be able to read the current state of many popular board games, and be able to detect what that state is with little to no user input. It will then convert the output of the image/video into a data structure that can be used in the next step. That is to take the current state of the game and use known algorithms and machine learning - depending on the game - in order to solve for the optimal move for the user. In essence, the main goal of this project is to allow for the software to quickly understand what is happening in a game, and output what the next best move is. While many websites and projects exist on the algorithm solving side, everyone I have used requires the user to input one by one the pieces or the state of the game. The long term goal is to integrate this program and the computer vision model into a mobile app, in order to make it much easier to quickly and possibly discreetly scan the state of the game and output the next move.
